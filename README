Description of the java code used by Timothy Hayward for the RGA first experiment dihadron analysis.

Letter: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04842

Updated now to include more generlized final states (changed from pi+ pi- assumed to user input for p1 and p2). 
In use with the current "back-to-back" proton-pi+ analysis.

Code relies on the CLAS12 quality assurance (QA) repository maintained by Christopher Dilks: https://github.com/JeffersonLab/clasqaDB
if desired, you can comment out that line in the processing.groovy script but any final analysis should likely be using the QA.


included scripts: 

I. processing.groovy
  I prefer to process the clas12 hipo4 files and create text outputs that I can then import into Mathematica, root, etc.
  It's not the most efficient but it is nicely universal. This script accepts 5 input arguments:
    1. hipo file directory 
      a directory such as, /cache/clas12/rg-a/production/recon/fall2018/torus-1/pass1/v0/dst/train/skim4/, that contains hipo4 data files.
    2. pid for p1 (momentum 1), i.e. 211 for pi+
    3. pid for p2 (momentum 2), i.e. -211 for pi-
    4. output text file name
    5. number of files to process in the directory
