!Generator!
TMDGen (/u/home/thayward/TMDGen or elsewhere)
Instruction files are placed in TMDGen/Examples/ 
TMDGen Syntax: $TMDGen/bin/TMDGen <instruction_file> <number_of_events>

!Conversion to LUND!
root macro located in /volatile/clas12/thayward/SIDIS/dihadron/TMDGen_output/rootToLund.cxx
Load into a root session, execute macro via
$.x rootToLund.cxx(<input root file>, <output LUND file>)
Generally output files to /volatile/clas12/thayward/SIDIS/dihadron/LUND_files/
